## Why did this cipher stop being useful?

### Book cipher is quite secure as long as it is dynamically changed and nobody except the communicating parties know what that algorithm is.

## What made it useful?

### What started to make it useful was when books were being massed produced so more people started to use it so they could send taxt about the book.

## What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?

### One interesting code that is similar to book cipher is poem code. It is interesting because  poem code was used in World War 2.
